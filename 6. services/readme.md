# 🧩 Lesson 8: Service in Kubernetes (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, you’ll understand —

- How pods communicate with each other
- How we connect to pods from outside the cluster
- The difference between **ClusterIP**, **NodePort**, and **LoadBalancer**

## 🧠 The Problem

Imagine you have **3 Nginx pods** (created via a ReplicaSet).  
Each pod has a unique IP address, for example:

```

10.32.0.5
10.32.0.6
10.32.0.7

```

Now, if a client (like a browser) wants to connect to your app —
which IP should it use? 🤔

Pods can die and restart anytime, and each time they get **a new IP**!
That means **Pod IPs are not fixed** ❌

So we **cannot use Pod IPs directly** to access applications.
And that’s where **Kubernetes Service** comes in 💡

## 🚀 What is a Service?

> A **Service** in Kubernetes provides a stable networking endpoint
> to access one or more pods — even if those pods die or get recreated.

So instead of connecting to changing Pod IPs,
you connect to a fixed **Service name**,
and the service automatically routes traffic to the correct pods ✅

## 🔹 Types of Services

There are mainly **3 types** of Kubernetes Services:

| Service Type     | Purpose                               | Access Level           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **ClusterIP**    | Internal communication inside cluster | Internal only          |
| **NodePort**     | External access via node IP + port    | External access        |
| **LoadBalancer** | Creates a cloud load balancer         | Public Internet access |

## 🧩 Part 1: ClusterIP (Default)

Imagine your 3 Nginx pods need to be accessed by another pod
(say a backend service), but **not from outside** the cluster.

For that, you use a **ClusterIP Service**.

### Example: `clusterip-service.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-clusterip
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

Apply and check:

```bash
kubectl apply -f clusterip-service.yaml
kubectl get service
```

Output example:

```
NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     PORT(S)   AGE
nginx-clusterip    ClusterIP   10.100.15.2    80/TCP    10s
```

🔒 This IP is **accessible only inside** the cluster.

## 🧩 Part 2: NodePort

Now suppose you want to access your pods from outside —
via browser or Postman.

For that, use **NodePort Service**.

### Example: `nodeport-service.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-nodeport
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080
  type: NodePort
```

Apply and check:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nodeport-service.yaml
kubectl get service
```

Output:

```
nginx-nodeport   NodePort   10.100.200.12   80:30080/TCP
```

🧠 You can now access it via:

```
http://<node-ip>:30080
```

If you’re using **Minikube**, simply run:

```bash
minikube service nginx-nodeport
```

It will automatically open your Nginx page in the browser 🎉

## 🧩 Part 3: LoadBalancer

Now imagine you’re running your cluster on a **cloud provider** (AWS, GCP, Azure).
You want to make your app **publicly accessible** via the Internet 🌍

Use **LoadBalancer Service**.

### Example: `loadbalancer-service.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-loadbalancer
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f loadbalancer-service.yaml
kubectl get service
```

Cloud provider will automatically create a **public IP**:

```
NAME                 TYPE           EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)
nginx-loadbalancer   LoadBalancer   34.120.51.203     80:30123/TCP
```

✅ You can now access your app from anywhere in the world!

| Kubernetes Concept | Burger Shop Example 🍔                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pod**            | Each cook                                        |
| **ClusterIP**      | Internal intercom (only inside the shop)         |
| **NodePort**       | Taking orders at the shop door                   |
| **LoadBalancer**   | Online delivery website (accessible to everyone) |
