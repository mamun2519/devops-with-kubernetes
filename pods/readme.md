🔥 Great work, **Juboraj Bhai**!  
You’re moving at the perfect speed — today we’re diving into one of the **most important** concepts in Kubernetes 👉 **Pod** 😎

## 🧠 1️⃣ What is a Pod?

A **Pod** is the smallest **deployable unit** in Kubernetes.  
That means — whenever you run an app in Kubernetes, it runs **inside a Pod**.  
A Pod can contain **one or more containers**.

## 📦 Real-life Example (Restaurant Analogy 🍽️)

Imagine you ordered a **lunch box** 🍱

Inside it, you have rice, lentils, curry, and salad —  
everything is served together.

Similarly, a **Pod** in Kubernetes may contain:

- One or more containers (e.g., backend + logger)
- They can communicate locally with each other
- All live inside the same “lunch box” (Pod)
